        - use POSIX::WEXITSTATUS() to find exit status instead of manual bit shift
        - added terminating signal handling via POSIX::WTERMSIG() (was mentioned in
          "DEVELOPMENT IDEAS" but finally spurred on by Lanny Ripple via
          http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=43541)
        - added t/06-signal.t

        - added 'tests => 11' import to 'use Test::Command' in SYNOPSIS
        - modified "No such file" tests to only test for $@ after the eval since
          the regex test wasn't valid for other languages
        - added development idea about creating a script to generate test files
